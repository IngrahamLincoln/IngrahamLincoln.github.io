Hello World and all that, 

I'm starting this blog because I need to have a place where all of my thoughts and research concerning AI can live. AI is taking the world by storm and I need to keep up. The best way to start is by having a place to distill what I have learned and to keep track of what I need to look into. The act of writing is useful because if I can't articulate these concepts, then what is the point? I don't write for anyone to read very often and so things will be a little clunky moving forward. Please pardon some intitial rambling, but getting into the habit of writing this blog is also going to help my brevity, and my articulation of the subject matter.

So let's start with some context. I'm still a first-year CS student. Something very unique has happened however. In the time it took for me to apply to SOU and start taking CS classes, ChatGPT was released. In my introduction to Python course, I did everything by hand. In my C++ course I used ChatGPT to help me learn and complete all of the assignments. Its as if the calculator was invented in the middle of the school year. 

Instantly the paradigm shifted. I knew what a force a competant text generator would have on the world. At the end of November of last year, around the time that OpenAI announced their little chat bot, I read a Wired article that said something to the effect of "real estate agents are going to be using this program for their house descriptions"

My immediate thought was one of shock. This wasn't just going to be used by the real estate sector, this was going to change our relationship with the entire world. A fundamental change as big as the internet itself. 

And so I spiraled into some classic existential dread. this wasn't just going to be a tool used by people to generate text. This was going to replace many of the people generating the text in the first place. heck, it could replace entry level coders. Sure it was buggy, slow, expensive, inaccurate, and not very well understood, but that didn't matter. This technology was only going to improve. Exponentially. 

And so, to combat this fear of the future changing rapidly I decided that I had to step up to the challange, if I could. if LLMs were going to outpace the average human in many arenas of intelligence, then I was going to learn how to use LLMs to keep up. I started devouring any information I could about how this stuff worked. I quickly realized what an undertaking this was. Not only did I not understand any of it, this technology is so complex that even it's creators didn't fully understand it. 

Over the course of the next few months I  watched subject matter experts in the field of AI consistently underestimate the capability of this technology. benchmarks that were predicted to stay un-met for a decade or more actively were being surpassed.
