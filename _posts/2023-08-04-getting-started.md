Hello World and all that, 

I'm starting this blog because I need to have a place where all of my thoughts and research concerning AI can live. AI is taking the world by storm and I need to keep up. The best way to start is by having a place to distill what I have learned and to keep track of what I need to look into. The act of writing is useful because if I can't articulate these concepts, then what is the point? I don't write for anyone to read very often and so things will be a little clunky moving forward.
