**A Continuing Effort to Organize My Thoughts**

-No AI generated text- 

As if the study  machine learning, deep learning, and AI wasn’t hard enough, I also have to wade through the flood of information regarding AI as a result of ChatGPT being released to the public. It’s everywhere, and trying to keep up can seem all but futile. It’s a new skill I’m having to learn, having to separate the noise from the signal. The hype is very real. 
To address this I can think of several options. I could:
1. Devote myself to keeping up with the cultural, political and economic impact WHILE simultaneously trying to learn the math, science, and theory behind the technology. Not to mention the fact that this tech is now affecting other fields like education, philosophy, psychology, etc.
-  This is “ideal” as I want to stay informed, but there is the very real risk of spreading myself too thin, or worse, burning out.
2. Ignore the coming waves of AI news and the hype that follows and stay focused on the math, and science aspect of the field. 
- This would allow me to learn and grow in my academic career more efficiently, but I think that the two sides to this coin are almost inextricably linked. I shouldn’t become so specialized that I miss connections and important dynamics that will be seen when getting the bigger picture. And there’s the plethora of opportunities to study the dynamic between this complex technology and its complex interaction with society. In fact there may just be a career in solely using AI to study its cultural impact. 
3. Try and devote more time to the technical side of things, so that I may actually learn how to be in this career, and find a routine in which I can catch up on the bigger societal and cultural picture. 
- Striking that balance is tricky, for right now I have my projects and areas of study and I just need to keep chipping away things as they come up. I’m taking classes, I’m doing the things. I need to pace myself. 

So what should that look like? What’s the ratio? 
- I need to keep coding. 
- I need to keep studying theory.
- I need to keep learning the math.
- I need to keep writing in order to articulate this information.

I feel like my success as a student in indeed going to be decided by how I figure this structure out. 

That leads me to a big question. How can I further science? How do I go about my studies in a manner that is conducive to the big picture? What questions do I need to be asking? What does science need to be answered? What am I capable of doing?

What are questions that nobody else is talking about? THAT’S a hard one. 
Because the industry has exploded as far as research being generated. 

 Short term questions
- How can I best leverage ChatGPT for school?
- How can I teach others how best to use ChatGPT?
- What can I do to allow the school to empower their student’s while still maintaining academic standards and integrity? A framework, or structure to augment the LLM. -What do API overheads cost?

Medium term questions
- Can I figure out a way to automate the methods to teach students/faculty how best to use ChatGPT? 
- Can I figure out a way to ensure the accuracy and validity of ChatGPT’s output? The interactability is there, the ease, and speed of use is there. The accuracy is not fully there yet. 

Long term questions.
- What can I do to solve the alignment issue?
- What can I do to better allow humanity to better understand itself so that we can ensure an AI is made that doesn’t reflect or perpetuate the worst of us?
- What can I do to use AI, ML and DL to study the brain, and the subjective conscious experience of our own perception?

Standing question for the duration of my academic career
- What connections am I missing? What are the unexplored possibilities available to me with this technology? I mean. I gotta be able to come up with more questions over time…


Coding, Computational thinking, data science, these are all valuable skills that I can’t ignore. And so I must balance this newfound passion/obsession/ with actual nose-to-the-grindstone effort in making the fundamentals second nature.
