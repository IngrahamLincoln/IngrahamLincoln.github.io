**Disclaimer:** I wrote a very rough draft for this post, in order for me to organize
my thoughts. I then conversed with chatGPT to produce a more polished and edited version that conveys my ideas in a more digestible manner. I will post the rough, unedited draft written by me at the end. 

The entire reason for this particular series of blog posts is that I’d like to submit a poster to SIGCSE 2024 regarding ChatGPT and education. My focus for this poster would be to address how I used ChatGPT to almost effortlessly learn and complete coding assignments, even though I had little to no experience with my terminal, bash, GitHub, or any number of common coding workflows. When given an assignment I was simply able to ask the right questions in order to complete it. I did this by using dialogic learning, metacognitive regulation, and prompt engineering. I'll be doing more blog posts that will go into those terms a bit more concretely. Additionally I believe
these strategies can generalize to any task or domain of study, regardless of knowledge level, or familiarity.

**The Modern Student's Toolkit: ChatGPT and the Future of Learning**

In a world overflowing with information, knowing where to look is half the battle, especially for students. Historically, we've navigated coding assignments with a medley of tools at our disposal:

- Assignment instructions
- Teacher interaction
- Google searches
- Stack Overflow
- Trial and Error
- Fellow students
- Knowledgeable friends or family 
- Forum postings
- Prior experience

Each source comes with its unique set of challenges: the time it takes to find an answer, the potential strain on personal relationships, or the accuracy of the information procured. But what if there was a tool that brought together the strengths of these disparate sources, offering the benefits of each without their respective drawbacks?

**Enter ChatGPT: The Swiss Army Knife of Learning**

ChatGPT provides an all-in-one solution. As a student, I innately understand there are questions more suited for Google than for my peers. Similarly, there's the hands-on value that only trial and error offers. But with ChatGPT, I can navigate these dynamics more effectively. By strategically framing my prompts, I can tailor the AI's response to suit my specific needs, whether it's understanding a concept or troubleshooting an error.

However, this potent tool also brings an ethical quandary: what stops me from merely asking, "give me the answer and how to implement it?" While the potential for misuse exists, there's no undoing the technological advancements. It's a genie that won't return to its bottle. Yet, when used judiciously, ChatGPT propels learners to new heights.

**From Confusion to Conversation**

Allow me to illustrate with an example. On receiving a coding assignment, my typical approach would be:

1. **Understanding the Brief**: I'd start by thoroughly reading the assignment's instructions.
2. **Initial Consultation with ChatGPT**: By feeding the assignment details into ChatGPT, I often received generic or incomplete code. Yet, this initial step helped in setting direction.
3. **Dialogue Over Monologue**: Rather than solely relying on the first output, I'd engage in a back-and-forth with the AI, iterating over its suggestions, refining my questions, and seeking clarifications.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: By thinking critically about my questions, I anticipated specific, context-rich responses from ChatGPT. This skill, vital for effective problem-solving, turned assignments into collaborative efforts.
5. **Validation**: Coding has the unique verification process – if the code compiles, it works! But, the principles of this workflow could be extended to other learning domains.

This approach transformed my learning process into a dynamic, evolving conversation that perfectly catered to my immediate needs.

**The Art and Science of Prompt Engineering**

To harness the full potential of ChatGPT, understanding prompt engineering is essential. It's more than just asking questions; it's about crafting queries that elicit the desired responses. It pushes us to think metacognitively about the information we seek, adding another layer to the learning process.

**In Conclusion: The Brave New World of Learning**

ChatGPT is undoubtedly revolutionizing education. While the tool's potential misuse looms large, its value in fostering a deeper, more engaging learning experience is undeniable. The question now is, how will educators and institutions adapt to this paradigm shift?

Rough draft:

In the past, a particular coding assignment would be completed using several different resources.
	1. Assignment instructions
	2. Teacher interaction
	3. Google
	4. Stack Overflow
	5. Trial and Error
	6. Fellow students
	7. Potential friend/family member who has relevant knowledge. 
	8. In some cases, posting to a forum for help.
	9. Prior knowledge
(Note to self. I should grade each of these on several metrics that affect their use. Maybe something like - difficulty, time it takes to get an answer, how taxing it is on the relationship, how difficult the answer is to implement, accuracy of information gained, availability of relevant information. Specificity to the particular need of the student, embarrassment of repeated use)

Each one of these avenues has a different dynamic to it. I as the student innately know that there are questions I can ask Google, that I can’t ask my fellow students. And there’s value to the hands-on approach that only trial and error can give. I wouldn’t ask my teacher to just do the assignment for me, but I would have a friend walk me through it step by step if I needed help. Even then, the friend might just know what to google, or where to look on stack overflow for the answer. Part of being a student is taking the relevant questions to the relevant sources.

With ChatGPT I have the benefits of all of those avenues at my fingertips. And that is what people don’t realize. With deliberate prompt engineering, I can steer the context window toward a particular style of answer, one that will address the assignment, my understanding, or any roadblock along the way. 

So, in the learning environment, prompt engineering is knowing how to recognize what question we need answered and articulate that. This is counterintuitive, because often these sources are mutually exclusive. If one avenue is unavailable, then that part of the task must be completed by going to a different source, and this can break up the flow of learning. 

It might seem cheap. What’s to stop me from saying “give me the answer, and also give me the steps to implement the answer”? Well.. nothing. That’s the thing. This technology is going to be used from now on. So even if there is the potential for abuse, there’s no putting the genie back into the bottle. 

But also think of the amazing complexity of output a student can instantly become capable of! I coded assignments that were complex and above my head but I learned as I went along. I learned by doing, and I didn’t waste time trying to figure it out. And yes I could have had ChatGPT do everything for me, but the ability to pseudocode, and use computational thinking, and the ability to plan and look ahead into solving the problem made the whole process that much easier.

Now, in the process of articulating my assignment completion strategies, I realize that I employed a constant level of abstraction to the learning process. I treated the assignments as a conversation with a tutor. A tutor that had access to far more technical knowledge and patience than a human, but a tutor nonetheless. 
Let me walk through the steps of how I completed a particular assignment. 
1. Read and attempt to understand assignment instructions
2. Copy/paste assignment instructions into ChatGPT
3. Observe and grade initial output. At this point the LLM would give me some generic code that almost always was not the code that I was looking for, or at the very least incomplete. I knew this  just by looking at the format of the output, from experience in previous assignments, and also because the code would not compile. 

	(note) - It’s important to point out that at this point, I had the opportunity to get frustrated that the output did not solve all of my problems immediately. However, being able to objectively address my lack of knowledge —in this case the inability to take that code and format it in VS code so I had something that compiled — allowed my to ask very forward and pointed questions to ChatGPT. 
4. At this point the process became less of a traditional coding assignment and more of a dialogue between the chat bot and myself. As I looked at the output, I simply told it that this was not useful to me in its current format, and now my task would be to convert into something that would compile. 
5. The magic here is that I never had to be lost at any point. Sure I didn’t have the information, but ChatGPT did. I just had to identify the right questions to ask. I would copy/paste error messages, ask for format changes, and even ask for help in navigating the coding program on my Mac. Instead of being confused, I could just ask any question I needed to ask, in order to get the job done. And If I needed to brush up on theory, technique, terminology, or common practices, then I could just ask those questions too. 
6. Here’s where prompt engineering comes in. A good practice for metacognitive problem solving is to stop and think about your question ahead of time, and try to anticipate what type of context-specific response you’ll get in return.  

Coding assignments are uniquely suited to this workflow in that there is only one way to verify that the output you’ve been given works. The code compiles! But by no means does this mean that these techniques can’t be employed to learn or do any skill. 

The ability for the process to be a dynamic conversation that is constantly evolving to fit my needs at that particular point in the assignment is wonderful. Let’s talk a little bit more about what makes this so unique.
