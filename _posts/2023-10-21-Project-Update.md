**What an outstanding couple of months**

- I had no idea what was in store. And right now I'm kicking myself for not properly documenting the journey. I admit that forming the daily habits have really been a struggle. 

- After the last post I really stuck my nose in the books. trying to stay relavent with regard to the research that is coming out this year at lightning speed. I am learning more about how llms work, prompt engineering, how all of this affects schools and education moving forward. 

- the culmination of that was a poster submitted to SIGSCE regarding prompt engineering and teaching students how to properly use AI. Its been a learning experience to say the least, because not only am I learning about a cutting edge subject, this is really the first time I've started reading scientific articles in such an involved fashion. 

- The process of writing a research paper is also an amazing challenge. I think I really grew a lot in that area. 

- right now I'm looking into system prompts for DALL-E 3 and getting an intuition for how that algorithm works. 

- also, I've got a major project i will be starting today. A semantic search engine for memories. In order to allow an LLM to maintain a more consistent state in the world with regard to interaction.
